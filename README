This code is used to compute the chern number of a system of 1 or 2 particles in a magnetic field. It does so by computing the berry gauge field and the berry curvature. 

The derivatives are calculated using second order Euler method, the integral using first order Euler method. The code is parallelized for faster computing on CPU.

The Quantum part is done in compute.hamiltonian.py, ie the Hamiltonian is computed and then diagonalized. The integrals and derivations are done in compute.mesh.py. Finally simulation puts it all together.

The code should be run through run.py

theoretical results is a note containing the theoretical results that should be obtain for a single particle with no magnetic field.

theta_tilde.py plots an interesting change of variables that could be used when doing the theoretical calculations for a single sphere in a magnetic field. Showing a sharp phase transition.
